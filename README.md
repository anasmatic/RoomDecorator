# RoomDecorator #
**code sample**
current version = 0.1

----------


This is a code sample from a personal project, it is still on progress work.

It has no game play or logic, just some structure and basic functions.

It is a helping tool for redecorating my baby's room!
and yes, I did that lame game art :)

- it was created with Flash Builder 4.6.
- it is an Android Air Project.
- developed with, flex sdk 4.6.0.
- used libraries: 
	- [starling](http://gamua.com/starling/),
	- 	[feathers](http://feathersui.com/download/),
	- 	[spautet's as3isolib Starling](https://bitbucket.org/spautet/as3isolib-starling/src/20de40eed53674464b9fbe56374dd82243686b9e/src/?at=master),

**[When Run On Flash Builder]**


when you run the project on FlashBuilder, choose from the Run Configuration

	Launch method: On desktop
	and choose "Samsung Galaxy Ace"
the project was not tested on mobile devices, or any other emulators.

----------

**[PROBLEM]** 

if there is nothing visible on the screen when you publish!

	open "src\RoomDecorator-app.xml"
	find <fullScreen>true</fullScreen>
	replace it with <fullScreen>false</fullScreen>
